## The Quick Version

Our events are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or healthcare choices.
We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks, workshops, fairs, socials, Twitter and other online media.
Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the organisers.


## Harassment includes

    * Offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, or healthcare choices
    * Inappropriate physical contact
    * Gratuitous display of sexual images in public spaces
    * Deliberate intimidation or threats of violence
    * Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
    * Stalking or following
    * Harassing photography or recording
    * Sustained disruption of presentations, discussions, or other events
    * Unwelcome sexual attention
    * Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, relationships, drugs, and employment.
    * Questioning or challenging someone's stated self-identity or chosen labels, even when they conflict with your own views.
      For example, discussions about the difference between bi vs pan, trans vs trans*, or whether grey/demisexual people are asexual, *even if well-intentioned*
    * Deliberate misgendering or use of ``dead'' or rejected names
    * Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
    * Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
    * Deliberate ``outing'' of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse
    * Publication, distribution, or other broadcast of non-harassing private communication

Jokes that resemble the above, such as ``hipster racism'', still count as harassment even if meant satirically or ironically.

## Marginalized people's safety is prioritizes over privileged people's comfort.

The administrators will not act on complaints regarding:

    * “Reverse”-isms, including ``reverse racism,'' ``reverse sexism,'' and ``cisphobia''
    * Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as ``leave me alone,'' ``go away,'' or ``I'm not discussing this with you.''
    * Communicating in a ``tone'' you don't find congenial
    * Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions


## Reporting

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an event staff member immediately.
[[TO DISCUSS: event staff members can be identified by wearing branded clothing and/or badges.]]
 
If the person who is harassing you is on the event staff, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident.
We will respond as promptly as we can.

This code of conduct applies to CTTGHC spaces, but if you are being harassed by a participant outside our spaces, we still want to know about it.
We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by CTTGHC participants, especially the event staff, seriously.
This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time.
The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from CTTGHC events based on their past behavior, including behavior outside CTTGHC spaces and behavior towards non-participants.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.
At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of CTTGHC members or the general public.
We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expelling them from the event with no refund.

Event staff members will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.
We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related socials.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.
In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.
Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
Booths specifically for kink and sex-positivity may share imagery in a consentual manner. For example, images may be shared in a binder or pamphlet with a clear label that there is explicit imagery inside.

### Discussion of labels

The LGBTQ community has a history of hurtful labels, either as slurs or as codes meant to dehumanize.
As the years have passed, our vocabulary has shifted.
Some labels have gone from commonplace to problematic and vice versa.
Labels are hard-won statements of self.

If you are unsure what a label means, feel free to research it externally or, if the person who used the label clearly consents to the conversation, ask them in private for a simple clarification, but understand that the CoC will most likely not favor you if the conversation goes awry.
Do not have these discussions in open spaces.
Because of their inherent complexity, it is too easy to step on toes even if you don't mean to, in very serious, hurtful ways.
